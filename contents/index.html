  This page is mainly about my research activity and, admittedly, is meant to be
  useful to me more than anything else. As I'm not terribly fond of
  people who take themselves <em>too</em> seriously, I'll refrain from bothering
  you right away with stuff such as my research interests and alike. If you're
  interested, you'll be able to find out anything you might possibly want to
  know about me (and likely much more) following the links on the left.

  (In case you're wondering where the flame-throwing guitar in the picture is
  coming from, that was a gift from the <em>Fermi</em>-LAT collaboration that
  was presented to me when I stepped down as analysis coordinator in March
  2016. Those were fun times.)

  e-mail is definitely the best way to get in touch with me&mdash;I'm not a big
  fan of instant messaging and you won't find me on
