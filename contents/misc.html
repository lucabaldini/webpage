<p>
  Here is a lundry list of some of the things that I periodically find
  myself doing. Non frequently enough, obviously, to be able to memorize them.
</p>


<h3>Basic pc setup</h3>

<p>
  Also know as the laundry list of things to do when I install Fedora on a new
  computer.
</p>

<p>
  A small <a href="misc/update.sh">shell script</a> to install all the
  necessary packages via dnf and pip,
  my email client <a href="misc/signature.txt">signature</a>,
  and the basic <a href="misc/env.bashrc">environment setup</a>, which can be
  installed through this simple <a href="misc/layout.sh">bash script</a>.
  Also, <a href="misc/checkout.sh">here</a> is a script to checkout the
  repositories I am currently working on.
</p>

<p>
  In order to get all the scripts, just do

  wget https://osiris.df.unipi.it/~baldini/misc/getscripts.sh

<h3>Setup thunderbird for the INFN mail server</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Incoming server: mail.pi.infn.it (IMAP, port 993,
    secure connection SSL, normal password);</li>
  <li>Outgoing server: smtp.pi.infn.it (port 465, authentication SSL,
    normal password).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Setup eduroam</h3>


<p>
  Find all the information
  <a href="http://www.pi.infn.it/index.php?id=732">here</a>.
  It goes without saying that you need the proper certificate, which you get
  from <a href="https://security.fi.infn.it/CA/mgt/INFNCA.pem">here</a>,
  and keep in mind that you have to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose PAP as inner authentication;</li>
  <li>Use username@pi.infn.it as the username (the password is the
    normal afs password).</li>
</ul>
