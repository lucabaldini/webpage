<p>
  Here is a lundry list of some of the things that I periodically find
  myself doing. Non frequently enough, obviously, to be able to memorize them.
</p>


<h3>Setup thunderbird for the INFN mail server</h3>

<p>
  Here is the basic information (more details
  <a href="http://www.pi.infn.it/servizi/calcolo/mail/">here</a>):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incoming server: mail.pi.infn.it (IMAP, port 993,
    secure connection SSL, normal password);</li>
  <li>Outgoing server: smtp.pi.infn.it (port 465, authentication SSL,
    normal password).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Mind that you'll have to accept the certificate and confirm the security
  exception by hand (both for the inbox and the smtp), which will screw up the
  thunderbird autodetection process. Not a big deal. And don't forget to import
  the address book and the signature.
</p>

<h3>Setup eduroam</h3>


<p>
  Find all the information
  <a href="http://www.pi.infn.it/index.php?id=732">here</a>.
  It goes without saying that you need the proper certificate, which you get
  from <a href="https://security.fi.infn.it/CA/mgt/INFNCA.pem">here</a>,
  and keep in mind that you have to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose PAP as inner authentication;</li>
  <li>Use username@pi.infn.it as the username (the password is the
    normal afs password).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Enable rpmfusion on Fedora 14+</h3>

<p>
  All the details are <a href="http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration">here</a>,
  but the bottmline is:
</p>

<p class="code">
  su -c 'yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm'
</p>


<h3>Key exchange with SLAC</h3>

<p>
  First of all, generate the key pair.
</p>

<p class="code">
  [lbaldini@nblbaldini ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa<br>
  Generating public/private rsa key pair.<br>
  Enter file in which to save the key (/home/lbaldini/.ssh/id_rsa):<br>
  Created directory '/home/lbaldini/.ssh'.<br>
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):<br>
  Enter same passphrase again:<br>
  Your identification has been saved in /home/lbaldini/.ssh/id_rsa.<br>
  Your public key has been saved in /home/lbaldini/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.<br>
  The key fingerprint is:<br>
  [omissis]<br>
  The key's randomart image is:<br>
  [omissis]
</p>

<p>
  Then append the public key (content of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) at the
  bottom of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the server (centaurusa).
</p>


<h3>SLAC hosts</h3>

<p>
  Get the latest file from
  <a href="ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/admin/known_hosts">here</a>
  and copy the content at the bottom of ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  (cleaning up all the obsolete SLAC entries).
</p>

<p>
  For more information about ssh at SLAC, see
  <a href="http://glast-ground.slac.stanford.edu/workbook/pages/getting_connected/pr_ssh_forunix.htm">here</a>
</p>

<h3>Mount remote disks with autofs</h3>

<p>
  First of all need to have autofs installed (and, since it is a service,
  system-config-services is also handy).
</p>

<p class="code">
  sudo yum install autofs system-config-services
</p>

<p>
  As soon as the service starts running, a /net folder is creates,
  where the available remote disks appear. You can create soft links.
</p>

<p class="code">
  sudo ln -s /net/pcglast47/data0 /data47a<br>
  sudo ln -s /net/pcglast47/data1 /data47b
</p>
