  I live with my beatiful wife, Melissa (she's a high-energy physicist, as well)
  and our daughters Emma Rose and Julia Donata. In addition, we share the house
  with our (female) cat Luna. No doubt I am outnumbered&mdash;gender wise.

  I am a passionate supporter of the
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> movement.
  As such, I consider companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon threats to
  everybody's freedom. If this all comes to you as shocking or surprising
  (or even just unfamiliar) I suggest you peek at the
  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> website and
  the <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>'s personal site.

  Bizarre as it might seem, I have a passion for digital typography and,
  particularly, for the <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a> and
  <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> typesetting systems.
  I proudly own an account for 0x$2.00 (two hexadecimal dollars) at
  <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/">Donald Knuth</a>'s
  <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html">Bank of San
  Serriffe</a>.

  Finally, I have played guitar and/or bass in a number of bands over the years,
  although, admittedly, I don't have much time for that, these days. (I doubt
  anyone will notice, either way.)
  <em>Soul Pirate</em> is the name of the last (reggae) band I played with, and
  they tell me they still have a facebook page, out there; you can check out our
  last (and only) EP
  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/soul-pirate/id552248087"><em>Vibration</em></a>!
