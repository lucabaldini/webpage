  I live with my beatiful wife, Melissa (she's a high-energy/astro physicist, as
  well) and our daughters Emma Rose and Julia Donata. In addition, we share the
  house with our (female) cat Luna. No doubt I am outnumbered&mdash;gender wise.

  I am a passionate supporter of the
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> movement.
  As such, I consider companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon threats to
  everybody's freedom. (And google has become pretty bad, too, over the years.)
  If this all comes to you as shocking or surprising (or even just unfamiliar)
  I suggest you peek at the
  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> website and
  the <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>'s personal site.

<p>
  Bizarre as it might seem, I have a passion for digital typography and,
  particularly, for the <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a> and
  <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> typesetting systems.
  I proudly own an account for 0x$2.00 (two hexadecimal dollars) at
  <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/">Donald Knuth</a>'s
  <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html">Bank of San
  Serriffe</a>.

  I have played guitar and/or bass in a number of bands over the years,
  although, admittedly, I don't have much time for that, these days. (I doubt
  anyone will notice, either way.)
  <em>Soul Pirate</em> is the name of the last (reggae) band I played with, and
  they tell me they still have a facebook page, out there; you can check out our
  last (and only) EP
  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/soul-pirate/id552248087"><em>Vibration</em></a>!

<p>
  Finally, I am an amateur liuthier (well, that might be too much, but in any
  event I like playing with wood and make things out of it that produce sounds).
  The image on the right portraits the pulsar guitar that I made as a gift to
  the former Fermi analysis coordinator Matthew Kerr.
