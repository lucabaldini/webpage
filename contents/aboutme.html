I live with my beatiful wife, Melissa (she's a high-energy physicist, as well)
and our daughters Emma Rose and Julia Donata. In addition, we share the house
with our (female) cat Luna. No doubt I am outnumbered&mdash;gender wise.

I am a passionate supporter of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> movement.
As such, I consider companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon threats to
everybody's freedom. If this all comes to you as shocking or surprising
(or even just unfamiliar) I suggest you peek at the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> website and
the <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>'s personal site.

Bizarre as it might seem, I have a passion for digital typography and,
particularly, for the <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a> and
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> typesetting systems.
I proudly own an account for 0x$2.00 (two hexadecimal dollars) at
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/">Donald Knuth</a>'s
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html">Bank of San
Serriffe</a>.

Finally, I play bass in a reggae band. Our name is <em>Soul Pirate</em>.
They tell me we have a facebook page, out there; in the meantime, you can
check out our last EP <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/soul-pirate/id552248087"><em>Vibration</em></a>!
