  This website was originally created some time in 2012 as a set of static html
  web pages generated through a small python package that I put together over a
  weekend, and then (kind of) maintained through the next 7 years.
</p>

<p>
  In May, 2019, I
  <a href="https://github.com/lucabaldini/webpage">rewrote everything from scratch</a>,
  mainly as an excuse for me to experiment with some of the features of Python 3
  (such as type annotation and built-in unicode support) that I was not (and,
  admittedly I am still not) very familiar with. Proudly, the appearence of the
  new website is essentially identical to the old version, but the underlying
  code is significanly better, so that I can sleep happier at night.

  (Not that I imagine anybody would really care about, but maybe one of the bits
  in the code that might be of <em>slightly</em> more general interest is the
  Python module that creates a <a href="publications.html">publication list</a>
  based on my <a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9785-7726">ORCID</a> profile.
  Check it out

  When I first showed the basic css style sheet to my wife and asked her
  "<em>How does the page layout look like?</em>" she said:
  "<em>Dry. Just like you are.</em>"
  I guess she didn't really like it.
