The HTML code for this website is automatically generated by a number of 
(admittedly not particularly well written) python scripts that I put together
over a weekend in my spare time in order to make the maintenance easier.

When I first showed the basic css style sheet to my wife and asked her
"<em>How does the page layout look like?</em>" she said:
"<em>Dry. Just like you are.</em>"
I guess she didn't really like it.
