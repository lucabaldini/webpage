<p>
  I am an active member of the <a href="http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Fermi</a>
  <a href="http://www-glast.stanford.edu/">Large Area Telescope</a>
  collaboration since 2002.
  As such, I have contributed to several different aspects of the LAT
  (a space-based, high-energy gamma-ray telescope) development and operation:
  from the construction of the silicon tracker to the assessment and monitoring
  of the instrument performance and, the scientific data analysis.
  Within the Fermi LAT collaboration I served as analysis coordinator and
  coordinator of the <em>Cosmic-Ray bubble</em> and the
  <em>Calibration and Analysis</em> and <em>Dark Matter and New Physics</em>
  Science Working Groups.
</p>

<p>
  I am the Italian Co-PI, as well as the convener of the
  <em>Science Analysis and Simulation Working Group</em> for the
  <a href="http://xanth.msfc.nasa.gov/ixpe/">IXPE</a>
  (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer) <em>Small Explorer</em> mission,
  launched on December 8, 2021. This is the coronation of a successful
  <a href="http://glast.pi.infn.it/pixie/pixie.html">R&amp;D activity</a>
  on gas pixel detectors for x-ray astronomical polarimetry I have partecipated in
  since 2001&mdash;giving significant contributions to the implementation of the
  data acquisition system, the event reconstruction software and the Monte Carlo
  simulation of the detector.

  <li class="event" data-date="2010&ndash;2014">
    I have been heavily involved in a long-term project (<em>Pass 8</em>) for a
    comprehensive revision of the Fermi LAT event level analysis, based on the
    experience gained while operating the instrument on orbit through the prime
    phase of the mission. Released on June 24, 2015, Pass 8 will be used for the
    archival form of the Fermi LAT data and constitutes a major step toward the
    full realization of the LAT scientific potential.

  <li class="event" data-date="2011&ndash;2012">
    While serving as a coordinator of the <em>Calibration and Analysis</em> LAT
    science working group I have been working on the study and characterization
    of the systematic uncertainties connected with the LAT response functions.
    I am one of the three corresponding authors of the reference
    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0067-0049/203/1/4">paper</a> on the

    I played a key role in the measurement of the inclusive Cosmic-ray electron
    spectrum. I gave significant personal contributions to several aspects of
    the analysis, including the event selection, the evaluation of the
    background contamination and the study of the systematic uncertainties.
    The first paper published on this subject by the collaboration in 2009 is
    still one of the most cited LAT papers.
    I am one of the three co-authors of a solicited review

    During the construction of the LAT silicon tracker I played a major role in
    the production and testing of the flight hardware, contributing to the
    definition and implementation of the test strategy and the characterization
    of the instrument performance. I took part to the environmental tests of the
     tracker modules, during which I was responsible for the electronics and DAQ.

    on gas pixel detectors aimed at exploiting the photoelectric effect for the
    measurement of linear polarization in x-ray astronomical sources.
    We designed, produced and successfully tested three generations of dedicated
    ASICs where the charge collecting anode and the readout electronics are
    fully integrated. In its current implementation, the sensor is essentially
    ready to be flown at the focus of an x-ray optic.
