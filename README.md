This repository is hosting the code (and the contents) for generating my personal (static-html) webpage at [http://osiris.df.unipi.it/~baldini](http://osiris.df.unipi.it/~baldini). Assuming you're not me, chances that you might care about anything in here are fairly slim. (Admittedly, this is a playground for me to experiment with Python 3 more than anything else.)

And, by the way, the code documentation is hosted at [readthedocs](https://webpage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).
